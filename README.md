## 📘 Overview

**StructSure** is a commissioned website developed to support a Civil Engineering thesis project at **Cavite State University (CvSU)**. The research focuses on advanced structural health monitoring of university facilities using:

- **Direct Rebound Hammer (DRH)**
- **Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity (UPV)**
- **Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR)**

The data and findings were produced by Civil Engineering students. This website was built to present and structure the research data in a clear, organized, and accessible format.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

To run the development server locally:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
